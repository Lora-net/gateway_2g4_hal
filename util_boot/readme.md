Switch LoRa 2.4Ghz concentrator MCU to DFU mode
===============================================


## 1. Introduction

This software is used to switch the concentrator in DFU mode in order to program
its internal MCU.

## 2. Usage

```console
./boot -d /dev/ttyACMx
```

## 3. Program binary file into internal MCU flash memory

Download the dfu-util tool from here: http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net

```console
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -t 0 -D ../mcu_bin/xxx_fwm_xxx.bin
```

This will automatically exit the DFU bootloader mode, the concentrator is now
ready to be used.
