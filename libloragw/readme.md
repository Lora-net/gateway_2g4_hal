LoRa 2.4Ghz concentrator HAL user manual
========================================

## 1. Introduction

The LoRa concentrator Hardware Abstraction Layer is a C library that allow you
to use a Semtech 2.4Ghz concentrator through a reduced number of high level C
functions to configure the hardware, send and receive packets.

## 2. Components of the library

The library is composed of the following modules:

* loragw_hal
* loragw_mcu
* loragw_aux

The library also contains basic test programs to demonstrate code use and check
functionality.

### 2.1. loragw_hal

This is the main module and contains the high level functions to configure and
use the LoRa concentrator:

* lgw_board_setconf, to set the configuration of the concentrator
* lgw_channel_rx_setconf, to set the configuration of the RX radios
* lgw_channel_tx_setconf, to set the configuration of the TX radio
* lgw_start, to apply the set configuration to the hardware and start it
* lgw_stop, to stop the hardware
* lgw_receive, to fetch packets if any was received
* lgw_send, to send a single packet (non-blocking, see warning in usage section)
* lgw_status, to check when a packet has effectively been sent

For a standard application, include only this module.
The use of this module is detailed on the usage section.

### 2.3. loragw_mcu

This module wraps the HAL functions into commands to be sent to the concentrator
MCU over USB interface as a serialized byte array.

* board configuration
* send/receive packets
* get status
* ...

### 2.4. loragw_aux

This module contains a single host-dependant function wait_ms to pause for a
defined amount of milliseconds.

The procedure to start and configure the LoRa concentrator hardware contained in
the loragw_hal module requires to wait for several milliseconds at certain
steps, typically to allow for supply voltages or clocks to stabilize after been
switched on.

An accuracy of 1 ms or less is ideal.
If your system does not allow that level of accuracy, make sure that the actual
delay is *longer* that the time specified when the function is called (ie.
wait_ms(X) **MUST NOT** before X milliseconds under any circumstance).

If the minimum delays are not guaranteed during the configuration and start
procedure, the hardware might not work at nominal performance.
Most likely, it will not work at all.

## 3. Software build process

### 3.1. Details of the software

The library is written following ANSI C conventions but using C99 explicit
length data type for all data exchanges with hardware and for parameters.

The loragw_aux module contains POSIX dependant functions for millisecond
accuracy pause.
For embedded platforms, the function could be rewritten using hardware timers.

### 3.2. Building options

All modules use a fprintf(stderr,...) function to display debug diagnostic
messages if the DEBUG_xxx is set to 1 in library.cfg

### 3.3. Building procedures

For cross-compilation set the ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE variables in the Makefile,
or in your shell environment, with the correct toolchain name and path.
ex:
export PATH=/home/foo/rpi-toolchain/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin:$PATH
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

The Makefile in the libloragw directory will parse the library.cfg file and
generate a config.h C header file containing #define options.
Those options enables and disables sections of code in the loragw_xxx.h files
and the *.c source files.

The library.cfg is also used directly to select the proper set of dynamic
libraries to be linked with.

### 3.4. Export

Once build, to use that library on another system, you need to export the
following files :

* libloragw/library.cfg  -> root configuration file
* libloragw/libloragw.a  -> static library, to be linked with a program
* libloragw/readme.md  -> required for license compliance
* libloragw/inc/config.h  -> C configuration flags, derived from library.cfg
* libloragw/inc/loragw_*.h  -> take only the ones you need (eg. _hal and _gps)

After statically linking the library to your application, only the license
is required to be kept or copied inside your program documentation.

## 4. Hardware dependencies

### 4.1. Hardware revision

The HAL has been written for a specific version on the 2.4 Ghz concentrator
hardware and firmware. The firmware to be used is given in the mcu_bin directory.
Please refer to util_boot/readme.md for information about how to flash it.

This code has been written for:

* Semtech 2.4GHz concentrator, 3 channels, SX1280 radio based.

The library will not work if there is a mismatch between the hardware version
and the library version.

### 4.2. USB communication

The HAL communicates with the concentrator through USB interface usin the linux
tty port provided with the lgw_board_setconf() function.

## 5. Usage

### 5.1. Setting the software environment

For a typical application you need to:

* include loragw_hal.h in your program source
* link to the libloragw.a static library during compilation
* link to the librt library due to loragw_aux dependencies (timing functions)

### 5.2. Using the software API

To use the HAL in your application, you must follow some basic rules:

* configure the board and radios before starting the HAL.
* the configuration is only transferred to hardware when you call the *start*
  function
* you cannot receive packets until one (or +) radio is enabled AND the
  concentrator is started
* you cannot send packets until the TX radio is enabled AND the concentrator
  is started
* you must stop the concentrator before changing the configuration

A typical application flow for using the HAL is the following:

	<configure the radios>
	<start the LoRa concentrator>
	loop {
		<fetch packets that were received by the concentrator>
		<process, store and/or forward received packets>
		<send packets through the concentrator>
	}
	<stop the concentrator>

**/!\ Warning** The lgw_send function is non-blocking and returns while the
LoRa concentrator is still sending the packet, or even before the packet has
started to be transmitted if the packet is triggered on a future event.
While a packet is emitted, no packet can be received (limitation intrinsic to
most radio frequency systems).

Your application *must* take into account the time it takes to send a packet or
check the status (using lgw_status) before attempting to send another packet.

Trying to send a packet while the previous packet has not finished being send
will result in the previous packet not being sent or being sent only partially
(resulting in a CRC error in the receiver).

### 5.3. Debugging mode

To debug your application, it might help to compile the loragw_hal function
with the debug messages activated (set DEBUG_HAL=1 in library.cfg).
It then send a lot of details, including detailed error messages to *stderr*.
