LoRa 2.4Ghz Gateway project
===========================

## 1. Core library: libloragw

This directory contains the sources of the library to build a gateway based on
a Semtech LoRa 2.4GHz concentrator board (a.k.a. concentrator).
Once compiled all the code is contained in the libloragw.a file that will be
statically linked (ie. integrated in the final executable).

The library also comes with few basic tests programs that are used to test the
different sub-modules of the library.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the libloragw directory for
more details.

## 2. Concentrator MCU firmware: mcu_bin

This directory contains the binary file to be flashed on the concentrator MCU.
There is a version with debug information "dbg_xxx.bin" and a release version
without those debug information "rlz_xxx.bin".
Please refer to util_boot/readme.md for more information about how to flash it.

## 3. Helper programs

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to use
the HAL library, and to help the system builder test different parts of it.

### 3.1. packet_frowarder

The packet forwarder is a program running on the host of a Lora gateway that
forwards RF packets receive by the concentrator to a server through a IP/UDP
link, and emits RF packets that are sent by the server.

Uplink: radio packets received by the gateway, with metadata added by the
gateway, forwarded to the server. Might also include gateway status.

Downlink: packets generated by the server, with additional metadata, to be
transmitted by the gateway on the radio channel. Might also include
configuration data for the gateway.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the packet_forwarder directory
for more details.

### 3.2. util_net_downlink

The downlink packet sender is a simple helper program listening on a single
UDP port, responding to PUSH_DATA and PULL_DATA datagrams with proper ACK, and
sending downlink JSON packets to the socket, with given frame parameters, at
regular time interval.
It is a network packet sender.

It can also be used as a UDP packet logger to store received uplinks in a
local CSV file.

Please refer to the readme.md file located in the util_net_downlink directory
for more details.

### 3.3. util_boot

This utility can be used to switch the concentrator in DFU mode in order to
program its internal MCU.
Please refer to the util_boot/readme.md to get information about how to use
dfu-util for flashing the MCU with binaries provided in the mcu_bin directory.

### 3.4. util_chip_id

This utility configures the concentrator to be able to retrieve its EUI.
It can then be used as a Gateway ID.

## 4. Compile and run instructions

All the libraries and test programs can be compiled and installed from the
root directory of this project.

### 4.1. Clean and compile everything

`make clean all`

### 4.3. Cross-compile from a PC

* Add the path to the binaries of the compiler corresponding to the target
platform to the `PATH` environment variable.
* set the `ARCH` environment variable to `arm`.
* set the `CROSS_COMPILE` environment variable to the prefix corresponding to
the compiler for the target platform.

An example for a Raspberry Pi target:

* `export PATH=[path]/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin`
* `export ARCH=arm`
* `export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-`

Then, from the same console where the previous environment variables have been
set, do:

`make clean all`

## 5. Third party libraries

This project relies on several third-party open source libraries, that can be
found in the `libtools` directory.
* parson: a JSON parser (http://kgabis.github.com/parson/)
* tinymt32: a pseudo-random generator (only used for debug/test)

## 6. Helper scripts

### 6.1. tools/rpi_configure_gpio.sh

This script is to be used when using the gateway board on a Raspberry Pi through
the adaptation board, in order to properly drive the MCU_RESET and MCU_BOOT0 pins.

## 7. Changelog

### v1.0.2 ###

* Initial release for LoRa 2.4Ghz gateway
